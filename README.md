# Data Science Bowl 3

## The plan:
1. Data
2. Framework
3. ???
4. Profit

* *application/*: In the folder application goes the stuff which is specific for this competition, stuff which cannot ever be used for other competitions.
* *configurations/*: In the folder configuration go the configuration files of your models
* *deep_learning/*: In the folder deep_learning go special and new deep learning layers
* *interfaces/*: In this folders are the interfaces which need to be maintained by the other application specific things, to keep working with the framework. (Mostly abstract classes)
* *scripts/*: Dump your random scripts here (e.g. to generate a pickle file which you will store, or to make plots, or stuff)
* *theano_utils/*: Dump your theano util functions here. Only the ones which need to import Theano!
* *utils/*: Dump your theano util functions here. Only the ones which DO NOT need to import Theano!

In the main folder only go a couple of basic scripts! Scripts which are needed to interact with in order to regenerate our results, go here. NOTHING ELSE.
